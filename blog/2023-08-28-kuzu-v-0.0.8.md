We're here to introduce KÃ¹zu 0.0.8, which is a minor bug-fix release together with some performance optimizations:
- Fixed a major bug in COPY on large datasets. [PR 1963](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1963)
- Implemented the [TopK optimization](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1949), significantly enhancing the performance of queries that involve ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses. We will delve deeper into this optimization in a blog post. (TODO: ziyi) [PR 1949](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1949)
- WITH CTE rewriter. (TODO: xiyang) [PR 1956](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1956)
- Updated our Rust doc with converting query result to arrow arrays.
- Fixed the size allocated for boolean values to match the size of the bit-packed data. [PR 1953](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1953/files)
