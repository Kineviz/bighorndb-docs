# LLMs and Graphs Part 1: RAG over Structured Data 

I spent a lot of time during December, especially during the holiday season to learn about
LLMs and within LLMs about "LLMs+graphs". By that, I mean the techniques people are 
experimenting with that use LLMS together with graph databases and knowledge graphs. 
There has been a lot of activity on this topic on social
media, blog posts, and research publications, which may have intimidated you if you are new to the area. 
If so, you're exactly my target audiece for this new blog post series I am starting. 
My goals are twofolds: 
1. Describe the area to people starting in simple terms using a consistent framework
and terminology. I hope to provide more technical depth and references than you might find in other blog posts (similar
to the depth if I were to prepare a lecture on the topic).
2. Mention several future work I think is important to
contribute to the topic. Here, I don't necessarily mean research contributions
but also approaches that are worth trying out if you are trying
to build question answering applications using LLMs+graphs. That said, most content that I read
are researchy even if they are published by engineers of commercial companies. This is inevitable since the area is so new.
