# Getting Started

Welcome to K첫zu!

Let's get started!
The following sections are intended to give a simple introduction to K첫zu with some hands-on experience, including how to install and use K첫zu through our CLI, and supported APIs.
We also cover essential parts of our Cypher query language.
For complete cypher statements we supported, please visit our [Cypher documentation section](../cypher).
For you to get started easily without any troubles of installing K첫zu locally, we also prepared some [Colab notebook examples](./python#colab-notebooks).

After you have worked through this tutorial, you might want to move on to reading [Data Import](../data-import/) to understand options available to start a database with data importation, or [Cypher](../cypher) to gain a more formal knowledge of the query language.
Those who are interested in our CLI and supported APIs can find more details in [Client APIs](../client-apis).
