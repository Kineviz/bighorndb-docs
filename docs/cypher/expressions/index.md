# Functions and Expressions
Within many clauses of high-level database query languages, such as WHERE, WITH, 
and RETURN in openCypher, you can perform computations using expressions. 
Expressions can be very simple or arbitrarily complex. Variables that bind to 
node and relationship properties, aliases from previous parts of the query, 
literals (i.e., constants), are examples of most simples expressions. 
Using logical and arithmetic operators, and functions recursively, 
you can create arbitrarily complex expressions.
